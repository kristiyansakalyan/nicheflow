# Reproducibility

## Tables

For all experiments described below, you can generate the tables shown in our paper using the [`print_eval_results`](../notebooks/print_eval_results.ipynb) notebook after running the corresponding evaluation scripts.

## Main results
To reproduce the main results reported in the paper, you can use the pre-trained checkpoints provided in the `main_ckpts.zip` file and run the evaluation scripts.

Before proceeding, make sure you have followed the instructions in the main [`README`](README.md) and have downloaded both the datasets and the main checkpoints.

Once everything is set up, run:
```bash
python nicheflow/eval_state_dict_ckpts.py
```

## $K$ Regions Ablation Study
To reproduce the results of the $K$ regions ablation study, download the `kregion_ablations_ckpts.zip` from [FigShare](https://figshare.com/articles/software/NicheFlow_-_Data_Checkpoints_and_Results/30426610) and extract the checkpoints into the [`ckpts/kregion_ablations`](../ckpts/kregion_ablations) folder. 

Once everything is set up, run
```bash
python nicheflow/eval_state_dict_ckpts_kregion_ablations.py
```

## $\lambda$ OT Ablation Study
To reproduce the results of the $\lambda$ OT ablation study, download the `ot_ablations_ckpts.zip` file from [FigShare](https://figshare.com/articles/software/NicheFlow_-_Data_Checkpoints_and_Results/30426610) and extract the checkpoints into the [`ckpts/ot_ablations`](../ckpts/ot_ablations) folder. 


Once everything is set up, run:
```bash
python nicheflow/eval_state_dict_ckpts_ot_ablations.py
```

## Our results
We also provide the evaluation results as CSV files, which are the same files generated by the evaluation scripts. If you prefer to download them directly, they are available on [FigShare](https://figshare.com/articles/software/NicheFlow_-_Data_Checkpoints_and_Results/30426610).

- **Main results**: Download `main_results.zip` and extract it into `outputs/eval_main/`.
- **$K$ regions ablation study**: Download `kregion_ablations_results.zip` and extract it into `outputs/eval_kregion_ablations/`.
- **$\lambda$ OT ablation study**: Download `ot_ablation_results.zip` and extract it into `outputs/eval_ot_ablations/`.

Once the files are in place, you can use the [`print_eval_results`](../notebooks/print_eval_results.ipynb) notebook to reproduce the tables shown in the paper.
